write me   story about a boy at the beachr

The boy at the beach loved the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. He loved to feel the sand between his toes and the sun on his face. He would spend hours building sandcastles and playing in the water.

One day, while the boy was playing in the sand, he found a shiny object buried in the sand. He dug it out and discovered it was a gold coin. The boy was excited and ran to show his find to his mom.

His mom was thrilled and told him to put the coin away in their special box at home. The boy was happy to have found such a special treasure at the beach.
