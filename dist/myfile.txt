write me a story about the man on the moon

It was a dark and moonless night. The only light came from the stars and the man on the moon. The man on the moon was a lonely figure. He had been up there for so long, and he had seen so many things. He had seen the rise and fall of civilizations. He had seen wars and famine. He had seen the birth and death of stars. And he had seen the beauty of the universe.

But tonight, he was feeling particularly lonely. He missed the company of humans. He missed the sound of their laughter. He missed the warmth of their embrace.

But he knew that he could never go back. He had made his decision long ago. He was the man on the moon, and he would never leave his post.
