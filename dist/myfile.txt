write me a short story about boy at park

One day, a young boy was at the park by himself. He was playing on the swings when he saw a girl he had never seen before. He thought she was very pretty, so he decided to go talk to her. When he got closer, he realized that she was blind. He didn't know what to say, so he just introduced himself. They ended up talking for a while and became friends. The boy was happy that he had made a new friend, and he was also happy that he had been able to help her enjoy the park.
