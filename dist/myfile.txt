write me a poem about being deuteranopia=

My vision is not what it used to be,
Colors are dull and hard to see.
My world is now a muted hue,
My deuteranopia is what I must go through.

My greens and blues are now a shade of gray,
My reds and yellows have gone astray.
My world is now a muted hue,
My deuteranopia is what I must go through.

My eyes can no longer see the vibrancy,
The beauty of the world is now a mystery.
My world is now a muted hue,
My deuteranopia is what I must go through.

But I will not give up hope,
I will find a way to cope.
My world is now a muted hue,
My deuteranopia is what I must go through.
