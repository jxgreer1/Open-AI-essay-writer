write a short story about how you were late to school but with a outlandish excuse explaining why you were late

It was a typical Monday morning and I was running late for school. I had overslept and was in a rush to get to class. As I was running out the door, I heard a loud crash and saw a giant purple elephant standing in my living room. I was so shocked that I stopped in my tracks.

The elephant looked at me with its big eyes and said, "I'm sorry I'm late, but I was stuck in a time warp and just got out. I was trying to get to school on time, but I got lost in the time warp and ended up here."

I was speechless. I had no idea what to say. I just stared at the elephant in disbelief.

The elephant continued, "I know it's a bit of an outlandish excuse, but it's the truth. I promise I'll be more careful next time."

I was still in shock, but I managed to nod my head and say, "Okay, I believe you. Just make sure you're on time next time."

The elephant smiled and said, "Thank you. I will."

With that, the elephant disappeared in a puff of purple smoke. I was left standing there, still in shock, but also relieved that I had a good excuse for being late to school.
